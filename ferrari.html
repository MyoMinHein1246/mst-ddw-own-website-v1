            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The Ferrari F8 Spider is a mid-engine, two-seater sports car that
              was unveiled in 2019. It is the successor of the Ferrari 488
              Spider, and shares its 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine with
              the Ferrari F8 Tributo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The F8 Spider has a retractable hardtop that can be opened or
              closed in 14 seconds, and a redesigned aerodynamic body that
              improves its performance and efficiency. It can accelerate from 0
              to 100 km/h in 2.9 seconds, and reach a top speed of 340 km/h.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also features a new steering wheel, a 7-inch touchscreen
              display, and a range of driving modes and assist systems. The F8
              Spider is one of the most powerful and versatile convertible cars
              in the world, combining the thrill of open-air driving with the
              excellence of Ferrari engineering.

            </p>
            <p>
              The 812 GTS is one of the most elegant and powerful cars in
              Ferrari's lineup, offering the exhilaration of open-top driving
              with the sophistication of a V12 engine.

              The Ferrari SF90 Stradale is a hybrid, plug-in, all-wheel drive
              supercar that was launched in 2019. It is the first Ferrari to
              have a V8 engine as its top-of-the-range model and the first
              Ferrari to feature three electric motors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SF90 Stradale has a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that
              produces 780 hp, and three electric motors that add another 220
              hp, for a total output of 1000 hp. It can accelerate from 0 to 100
              km/h in 2.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 340 km/h. It also has
              a 7.9 kWh battery that allows it to travel up to 25 km in electric
              mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SF90 Stradale is one of the most advanced and powerful cars
              ever made by Ferrari, combining the best of both worlds: the
              performance of a racing car and the efficiency of a hybrid car.

              The Ferrari Roma is a front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive coup√©
              that was introduced in 2019. It is inspired by the elegance and
              style of Rome in the 1950s and 1960s, representing a new concept
              of Ferrari GT car.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Roma features a 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that
              produces 620 hp, coupled with an eight-speed dual-clutch
              transmission. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds
              and reach a top speed of 320 km/h.
            </p>
            <p>
              With its sleek and modern design, the Roma boasts a minimalist
              interior, a 16-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 8.4-inch
              touchscreen infotainment system. It stands as one of the most
              refined and sophisticated cars in Ferrari's history, combining the
              performance of a sports car with the comfort of a grand tourer.
